*Every Go program is made up of packages.*

Golang itself is made of packages. They're called [Go Standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std). Instead of downloading a massive "the answer to life the universe and everything" framework like .Net and Java did back in the day, you only download the packages you'll be using inside your own program. 

The packages mentioned on the page `"fmt"` and `"math/rand"` are part of this standard library. You may be wondering why the `fmt` package is just `fmt` but there's `math/` in front of `rand`. That's how the Go standard library is organized. `fmt` package is a package concerning functions of formatted I/O. `rand` package is a package concerning pseudo-random number generators. `math` is a package of packages containing `big`, `bits`, `cmplx` and `rand`, all with their own purposes, but all of them are about mathematics.

What if we import the whole `math` package instead of `math/rand` and use `math.rand.Intn(10))` instead of `rand.Intn(10))`
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("My favorite number is", math.rand.Intn(10))
}
```
When you run this version on A Tour of Go page, it'll result in this error message:
```
./prog.go:9:39: cannot refer to unexported name math.rand
```
Interestingly the same code on the [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/NBXOTfRwxo_g) first deletes importing of `math` package in its automatic format step, then returns this error:
```
./prog.go:8:39: undefined: math
```

We'll discuss what unexported means in the next page, then both error messages will make more sense.
