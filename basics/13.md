## Basic types and Zero values

[[Type conversions] https://go.dev/tour/basics/13](https://go.dev/tour/basics/13)

The page summarizes the type conversions between numeric types. But the page is missing a serious conversion subject. Converting to and from (or parsing) strings.

Go has a seperate package for converting values to and from strings called [strconv](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv). This package contains functions to do the conversions both ways, Parse**X** for converting strings into **X** types and Format**X** to convert **X** types into strings. And these functions works for each and every bacis type. So when we talk about a parse function, we're talking about `ParseBool`, `ParseComplex`, `ParseFloat`, `ParseInt` and `ParseUint` and the same goes for Format function. 

Every Parse function returns the expected type and an error if the conversion is impossible. Let's first get `bool` and the error out of the way. 

### Bool conversions
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	b1, err := strconv.ParseBool("true")
	fmt.Printf("Value of b1 is %t and the type of b1 is %T\n", b1, b1)
	b2, err := strconv.ParseBool("1")
	fmt.Printf("Value of b2 is %t and the type of b2 is %T\n", b2, b2)
	b3, err := strconv.ParseBool("2")
	fmt.Printf("Value of b3 is %t and the type of b3 is %T\n", b3, b3)
	fmt.Printf("The err is %s\n", err)
	s1 := strconv.FormatBool(b1)
	fmt.Printf("Value of s1 is %s and the type of s1 is %T\n", s1, s1)
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/BnmdO8p24NF)
```
Value of b1 is true and the type of b1 is bool
Value of b2 is true and the type of b2 is bool
Value of b3 is false and the type of b3 is bool
The err is strconv.ParseBool: parsing "2": invalid syntax
Value of s1 is true and the type of s1 is string
```
`ParseBool` function returns `true` for string values `true` or `1`, `false` for string values `false` or `0` and returns an error othervise.

### Numeric conversions
Parse functions return the widest of their type, namely `int64`, `uint64`, `float64` and `complex128`. The four methods accepts a `bitsize` argument to narrow down its returned value, but still into a widest of the type. For the sake of simplicity (and knowing by my experiences that it'll be the most used one) I'll provide the examples for integers.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	i64, _ := strconv.ParseInt("2147483648", 10, 64)
	fmt.Printf("Value of i64 is %d and the type is %T\n", i64, i64)
	i32, _ := strconv.ParseInt("2147483648", 10, 32)
	fmt.Printf("Value of i32 is %d and the type is %T\n", i32, i32)
	i16, _ := strconv.ParseInt("2147483648", 10, 16)
	fmt.Printf("Value of i16 is %d and the type is %T\n", i16, i16)
	reali16 := int16(i16)
	fmt.Printf("Value of reali16 is %d and the type is %T\n", reali16, reali16)
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/caw5_efyFut)
```
Value of i64 is 2147483648 and the type is int64
Value of i32 is 2147483647 and the type is int64
Value of i16 is 32767 and the type is int64
Value of reali16 is 32767 and the type is int16
```

The second argument `ParseInt` and `FormatInt` functions accept is the base. An integer can be represented on any base from 2 to 16 in its string form. The following example shows formatting and parsing integers in base 16.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	s := strconv.FormatInt(-42, 16)
	fmt.Printf("Value of s is %s and the type of s is %T\n", s, s)
	i64, _ := strconv.ParseInt("2da8", 16, 64)
	fmt.Printf("Value of i64 is %d and the type of i is %T\n", i64, i64)
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/ylO1J1YePVm)
```
Value of s is -2a and the type of s is string
Value of i64 is 11688 and the type of i is int64
```

Again knowing that most of the conversions from and to `int` (the auto-sized integer) and in base 10, strconv package provides us two *convenience* functions called `Atoi` that is string to int and `Itoa` that is int to string.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	s := strconv.Itoa(-42)
	fmt.Printf("Value of s is %s and the type is %T\n", s, s)
	i, _ := strconv.Atoi("-42")
	fmt.Printf("Value of i is %d and the type is %T\n", i, i)
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/Davj4OhjfIb)
```
Value of s is -42 and the type is string
Value of i is -42 and the type is int
```

There are lots of useful functions inside strconv package. Don't try to memorize all of them, the [Go Packages page](https://pkg.go.dev/) will be your in your favorite place to visit while programming with Go anyways. But remember you know what you can do that package by memorizing outlines of [it](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv).
