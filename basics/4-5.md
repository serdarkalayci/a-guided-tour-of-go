There's nothing too fancy on function declerations. It's readable, it's simple. I just wish it to be more readable and simpler. Let me tell you what I mean.

When programming languages gives more than one option to do the same thing, people tend to love that language more, because it'll fit their own personal preference whatever it is better. But programming is rarely a one-person show, and there should be some kind of agreement in a team of collaborators to achive maximum efficiency throughout the team. I prefer the language itself be more strict about how things are done than individuals decide how to do that. Go is more on the strict side amongst the languages about its idiomatic ways but still offers some flexibility. Here, I'll give you some examples how those flexible options may ruin the team efficiency.

On the [Functions continued]((https://go.dev/tour/basics/5)) page you can see that you can group parameters that share a type together. 

> When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

It doesn't matter if your function takes two integers to sum them. But in real life, things are rarely that simple. Consider a function takes a person's name (string) and age (int), the name of the product he/she is buying (string) and the amount to buy (int).

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sellProduct("Serdar", 45, "orange", 3)
}

func sellProduct(name string, age int, productName string, amount int) {
	fmt.Printf("%s, aged %d, bought %d x %s.", name, age, amount, productName)
}
```

Now, for the sake of parameter grouping let's consider the following code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sellProduct("Serdar", "orange", 45, 3)
}

func sellProduct(name, productName string, age, amount int) {
	fmt.Printf("%s, aged %d, bought %d x %s.", name, age, amount, productName)
}
```

Which one is more readable? Which one is more error-prone especially from the point of view of the consumers of our function? Do you want your application to sell 45 Serdars to orange, who is at the age of 3?

**It's always a good practice to order your parameters first logically, then by their type, and group them if you prefer. Don't order your parameters to create groups just because you can.**
