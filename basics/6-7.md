## Multiple Results and Named return values

On the [Named return values](https://go.dev/tour/basics/7) page, you learnt that Go supports named return values. This is a great feature especially when there are more than one return value of the same type. If you have a function which returns an integer and an error, it's idiomatic to skip named return values totally. Consider a function return the smaller of the given two integers, and return an error if the two are the same. The following function definition is self-explanatory enough.
```go
func smaller(x, y int) (int, error)
```

But consider a function which calculates and returns the number of oranges and apples you can buy with the leftover money within a given budget. If you define this function as
```go
// buyFruits calculates withing the budget limit, how many oranges and apples we can buy
// For the sake of simplicity, this function favors oranges over apples
// Returns the number of oranges and apples we can buy, and the leftover money
func buyFruits(budget, priceOrange, priceApple int) (int, int, int) {
	oranges := budget / priceOrange
	leftover := budget % priceOrange
	apples := leftover / priceApple
	leftover = leftover % priceApple
	return oranges, apples, leftover
}
```

it will be impossible for the consumers of our function to make sense of the return values without reading the function summary. We can define the same function usin named return values like this
```go
// buyFruits calculates withing the budget limit, how many oranges and apples we can buy
// For the sake of simplicity, this function favors oranges over apples
// Returns the number of oranges and apples we can buy, and the leftover money
func buyFruits(budget, priceOrange, priceApple int) (oranges, apples, leftover int) {
	oranges = budget / priceOrange
	leftover = budget % priceOrange
	apples = leftover / priceApple
	leftover = leftover % priceApple
	return
}
```

This time our function signature makes sense, and we used a naked return. The page suggests to use naked returns in short functions but there is another catch. You can use non naked (named) return together with the named return values like this
```go
// buyFruits calculates withing the budget limit, how many oranges and apples we can buy
// For the sake of simplicity, this function favors oranges over apples
// Returns the number of oranges and apples we can buy, and the leftover money
func buyFruits(budget, priceOrange, priceApple int) (oranges, apples, leftover int) {
	oranges = budget / priceOrange
	leftover = budget % priceOrange
	apples = leftover / priceApple
	leftover = leftover % priceApple
	return oranges, apples, leftover
}
```

But if the types match, there's the risk of jumbling the order of the values on the return line like this
```go
// buyFruits calculates withing the budget limit, how many oranges and apples we can buy
// For the sake of simplicity, this function favors oranges over apples
// Returns the number of oranges and apples we can buy, and the leftover money
func buyFruits(budget, priceOrange, priceApple int) (oranges, apples, leftover int) {
	oranges = budget / priceOrange
	leftover = budget % priceOrange
	apples = leftover / priceApple
	leftover = leftover % priceApple
	return apples, oranges, leftover
}
```

As you can see, even though we calculated everything correctly, a shuffle in the return line made our function to return wrong results.

**It's always best practice to decide which method works best with your function. Sometimes naked return makes sense and prevents mistakes, sometimes named returns doesn't add value to your code. Think about readability and potential pitfalls and develop defensively.**
