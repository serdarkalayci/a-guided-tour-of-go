> The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.

Remember when we talked about [Variable Shadowing](../packages-variables-functions/8-9-10.md) on variables' topic. While using for loops with the de init statement, you have to keep an eye on variable shadowing. Because `for` is an inner scope of the function it resides in, the Go compiler will not warn you about a duplicate variable definition. In the following code, the variable `i` is declared twice. First as a string in the function scope and as an integer in the for loop's scope.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 0
	i := "this is a string"
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("i=%d\n", i)
		sum += i
	}
	fmt.Printf("i=%s\n", i)
	fmt.Printf("sum=%d\n", sum)
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/yCNlOZMAqdD)
```
i=0
i=1
i=2
i=this is a string
sum=3
```
The program compiles and runs smoothly, `i` being an integer inside the `for` loop and a string outside `for` loop's scope. If you want to use the variables from outer scope, it's always possible to use `for` loop without an `init` part, even without a `post` part like a `while` loop.
The page [For is Go's "while"](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/3) mentions that you can ditch semicolons, but keep in mind that, you can ditch both of them or none of them. So while the following formats are valid,
```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
	...
}
```
```go
for sum < 100 {
	...
}
```
```go
i := 0
for ; i < 10; i++ {
	...
}
```
```go
for i := 0; i < 10; {
	i++
}
```
the following formats are not.
```go
i := 0
for i < 10; i++ {
	...
}
```
```go
for i := 0; i < 10 {
	i++
}
```

### A note on forever
Forever loop (conditionless for, infinite loop) is usually thought as a thing that a programmer should avoid as it will block the application forever (or until you kill it forcibly). While this is true, you may wonder why there's a separate page on A Tour of Go dedicated to it. Forever loop is extensively used in Go, especially in concurrency context that we'll inspect later. For now just keeping in mind that it works and it has its uses would be enough.
