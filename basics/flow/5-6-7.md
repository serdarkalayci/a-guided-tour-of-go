As you may have already guessed by the time you saw that `if` also supports one liner variable definition, the risk of [Variable Shadowing](../packages-variables-functions/8-9-10.md) is also present for `if` just like the `for` clause. So instead of going over the same things again, let's focus on why we should use this syntax. 

The following two code blocks look like they are doing exactly the same thing, but in fact, the second one doesn't even compile because the scope of `i` is limited to the `if` block.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	i := getTheValue()
	if i == 0 {
		fmt.Println("i is zero")
	}
	fmt.Printf("The value of i is still %d\n", i)
}

func getTheValue() int {
	return 0
}
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	if i := getTheValue(); i == 0 {
		fmt.Println("i is zero")
	}
	fmt.Printf("The value of i is still %d\n", i) // Here we cannot access to the variable i
}

func getTheValue() int {
	return 0
}
```

Besides the scope difference, there's also a subtle difference of readability. It's a subtle difference here, but it becomes more important when things get more complicated. 

First thing first, Go doesn't have an "elegant" way of handling error like many other language out there have. The main aim of Go is to keep things simple, keep the number of keywords of the language as small as possible. So no `try`, `catch` and `finally` keywords just to deal with error handling. All you have is the [errors package](https://pkg.go.dev/errors), built-in [error type](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#error) and `if` clauses. We talked about [Multiple Return Values](../packages-variables-functions/6-7.md) already, and if a function wants its caller to deal with the errors it may have, it returns this error together with its regular returns values. It is then idiomatic to call this function in an `if` statement and deal with the error right away.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	if i, err := strconv.Atoi("3"); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("The provided value cannot be converted to integer. The error is: %s\n", err.Error())
	} else {
		// Do whatever with the integer value
		fmt.Printf("The value is %d\n", i)
	}
}
```

You can see clearly that I used the variable `i` inside the `else` block because it's scoped to the if block, which includes else part also. In a real world application putting everything what's going to happen if there are no errors (the happy path we hope to follow) is not a good idea though. Nested flow controls increase [cognitive complexity](https://sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf) quickly and the maximum value of cognitive complexity for a single function is 15. If you use two `if` blocks consecutively each of them add 1 to the cognitive complexity. When you use two `if` clauses in a nested manner, the outer `if` adds 1 and the inner `if` adds 2. That's why you'll see `if error return` pattern a lot more than tha usage of `else` blocks. Our code from the previous examples becomes the following
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	var i int
	var err error
	if i, err = strconv.Atoi("3"); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("The provided value cannot be converted to integer. The error is: %s\n", err.Error())
		return
	}
	// Do whatever with the integer value
	fmt.Printf("The value is %d\n", i)
}
```

But you also have to keep in mind, using this approach needs the variables to be defined outside the scope of `if` and will mean that these variables will stay in the memory longer. You can see I even declared err even if I don't need that variable outside the scope of `if`.

**The choices here are a tradeoff of between understandability and memory utilization. Also when using short variable declaration with the if statement, always keep an eye on variable shadowing.**
