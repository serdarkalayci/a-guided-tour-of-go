_A note on the [Switch](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/9) example. There's a warning about tha time being fixed in the go playground on the next page, but nothing on this page, and this may still be a bit confusing for some people. The code running on the Go Playground are in fact run inside a Linux container, so this example will always show `Go runs on Linux.`, independent of your operating system. You can run this code on your local environment to see the actual result._  

> A switch statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of if - else statements.

But remember the attitude of Go, _fewer keywords to remember with maximum utilization_. There's no `break` keyword in Go. When one of cases matches the criteria, it will execute and quit the switch statement. This makes ordering of the items more important comparing to the languages with breaks in their switch statement. Consider a scenario where we try to assign a label to a person (although labeling people is not a good thing to do) based on their age. We'll label them as "infant" if their age is below 1, as "child" if their age is between 1 and 12, as "teen" if their age is between 13 and 19, and as "adult" otherwise. If we write our statement as below, it'll give us the wrong label as it is the first case it matched.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	age := 25
	switch {
	case age > 1:
		fmt.Println("Child")
	case age > 12:
		fmt.Println("Teen")
	case age > 19:
		fmt.Println("Adult")
	case age < 1:
		fmt.Println("Infant")
	}
}
```

Child
```

You can argue that we should be more precise on the conditions on our case statements. We can write the code above like the one below and it'll work right this time.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	age := 25
	switch {
	case age > 1 && age < 13:
		fmt.Println("Child")
	case age > 12 && age < 20:
		fmt.Println("Teen")
	case age > 19:
		fmt.Println("Adult")
	case age < 1:
		fmt.Println("Infant")
	}
}
```

Adult
```

But this introduced more cognitive load to those who'll read our code later, and also did more comparison than we needed, and this kind of choices affect the performance of our code. Instead, we should order our cases more carefully to allow us to use simpler comparisons while working as expected.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	age := 20
	switch {
	case age < 1:
		fmt.Println("Infant")
	case age < 13:
		fmt.Println("Child")
	case age < 20:
		fmt.Println("Teen")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Adult")

	}
}
```

> Go's switch cases need not be constants, and the values involved need not be integers.

This creates lots of options of using a switch statement. You can put your variable on the switch statement and use constants on cases. You can put a constant on switch statement and put variables to case statements. You can leave switch statement empty and put conditions (which don't have to be related to each other at all) on case statements. Although it doesn't make too much sense, the following code is valid. 
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	i, j := 5, 16
	t := "This doesn't make sense"
	switch {
	case i < 4:
		fmt.Println("i is less than 5")
	case j < 13:
		fmt.Println("j is less than 13")
	case t == "This doesn't make sense":
		fmt.Println(t)
	}
}
```

You have to keep in mind that only one of the cases will execute, so if we assign `10` to the variable `j`, it'll become impossible to see that `t` also fulfils its criteria.
