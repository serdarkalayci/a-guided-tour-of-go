## Pointers

[[Pointers] https://go.dev/tour/moretypes/1](https://go.dev/tour/moretypes/1)

> Go has pointers.

This simple statement means much more than you expect from it. The fields of a struct obeys 

Unless you explicitly use pointers, Go passes the arguments of a function as values. Which means, when you pass a variable as an argument to a function which modifies the value of that argument, value of the original variable of the calling function does not change.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a int = 0
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the main function a=%d\n", a)
	inc(a)
	fmt.Printf("End of the main function a=%d\n", a)
}

func inc(a int) {
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the inc function a=%d\n", a)
	a++
	fmt.Printf("End of the inc function a=%d\n", a)
}
```

```
Beginning of the main function a=0
Beginning of the inc function a=0
End of the inc function a=1
End of the main function a=0
```
As you can see in this example, the value of the variable `a` did not change even the value of the argument is increased by 1 by the inc function. This may be the behavior you want, but what if you want to modify the value of the original variable inside another function? You use pointers.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a int = 0
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the main function a=%d\n", a)
	inc(&a)
	fmt.Printf("End of the main function a=%d\n", a)
}

func inc(a *int) {
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the inc function a=%d\n", *a)
	*a++
	fmt.Printf("End of the inc function a=%d\n", *a)
}
```

```
Beginning of the main function a=0
Beginning of the inc function a=0
End of the inc function a=1
End of the main function a=1
```

First let's take a look at the `inc` function. It accepts an `*int` (integer pointer) argument instead of an `int`. By declaring its signature like this, `inc` function says to its callers that "send me a memory address that points to an int variable". So for the `inc` function the argument `a` is not an integer, instead it is a memory address pointing to an integer. That's why each and every time we tried to do interact with the value inside the `inc` function, we had to use access its value by **indirecting** or **deferencing** the pointer variable with the form `*a`.
The main function defines the variable as an `int`, so when the `inc` function asks for a memory address pointing to an integer value, the main function had to send the address of the variable by **referencing** with the form `&a`.
What would we see if we don't deference the argument in the `inc` function? We can easily observe the real value `a` holds inside the inc function by printing its value with its pure form.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a int = 0
	inc(&a)
}

func inc(a *int) {
	fmt.Printf("The value a holds is %d\n", a)
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/2tx17WPjVe7)
```
The value a holds is 824634359808
```
As you can see the argument `a` of type `*int` holds some kind of numeric value, and when you run the program over and over the value changes. That is the memory address the variable `a` holds its value when it's first declared in the main function.

What if we try to increase the value of the argument `a` without deferencing?
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a int = 0
	inc(&a)
}

func inc(a *int) {
	fmt.Printf("The value a holds is %d\n", a)
	a++
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/A-2ZgdNUoXx)
```
./prog.go:12:2: invalid operation: a++ (non-numeric type *int)
```
This output shows us that even if the pointer looks like a numeric value (and in fact it is, in terms of how operating systems interact with the hardware), it's not a numeric value for Go. In other languages utilizes pointers like C, the pointers themselves are integers, and you can add a certain values to it in order to move to a different position, e.g. iterate through an array. Go does not allow those kinds of operations, hence the last sentence on the page.

> Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.

If the whole point of using pointers modifying the value of an argument, why bother using pointers instead of using return values? We could easily modify our `inc` function to return an `int` value and set it to the original variable right? Yes it'll create the same results without the "assumed" complexity of pointers.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a int = 0
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the main function a=%d\n", a)
	a = inc(a)
	fmt.Printf("End of the main function a=%d\n", a)
}

func inc(a int) int {
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the inc function a=%d\n", a)
	a++
	fmt.Printf("End of the inc function a=%d\n", a)
	return a
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/kNPzj5P7y4f)
```
Beginning of the main function a=0
Beginning of the inc function a=0
End of the inc function a=1
End of the main function a=1
```
The outcome is the same. Now let's see the difference between this solution with the pointer usage.

### With pointer argument
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a int = 0
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the main function a=%d\n", a)
	inc(&a)
	fmt.Printf("End of the main function a=%d\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("The address of a in the main function is %d\n", &a)
}

func inc(a *int) {
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the inc function a=%d\n", *a)
	*a++
	fmt.Printf("End of the inc function a=%d\n", *a)
	fmt.Printf("The address of a in the inc function is %d\n", a)
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/I14zWcpv95c)
```
Beginning of the main function a=0
Beginning of the inc function a=0
End of the inc function a=1
The address of a in the inc function is 824634474496
End of the main function a=1
The address of a in the main function is 824634474496
```
### With return value
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a int = 0
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the main function a=%d\n", a)
	inc(a)
	fmt.Printf("End of the main function a=%d\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("The address of a in the main function is %d\n", &a)
}

func inc(a int) {
	fmt.Printf("Beginning of the inc function a=%d\n", a)
	a++
	fmt.Printf("End of the inc function a=%d\n", a)
	fmt.Printf("The address of a in the inc function is %d\n", &a)
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/fuHffQR01uf)
```
Beginning of the main function a=0
Beginning of the inc function a=0
End of the inc function a=1
The address of a in the inc function is 824633819192
End of the main function a=0
The address of a in the main function is 824633819184
```

As it can be clearly seen, the `inc` function with integer pointer argument uses the exact same variable created by the main function, the memory address is the same throughout the program. In the version with the integer argument and return value, the `inc` function uses a **copy** of the variable, their memory address is not the same in the `main` function and `inc` function. It may not be seen as crucial as it should be for an integer argument but copying a variable with a bigger memory footprint over and over throughout the program will increase the memory usage and put a heavy load on the garbage collector. Also copying a huge memory block on each function call will negatively affect your application's performance.

The context package I mentioned on the previous page offers a way to carry over some **contextual** data over a span of function calls. Also, methods (a topic we will be discussing later) can help us carry over some data between method calls. On those separate topic we'll again discuss which is the best way to carry over the data in which cases, but for now, for simple function calls, it breaks down to this:

**The pointer usage helps the memory management, and gives an easy way to modify the contents of the variables on the inner functions. But it is also prone to unexpected changes to your variable. Value arguments on the other hand are hard on memory consumption and overall performance of the application.**
