> A struct is a collection of fields.

A struct in Go is very similar to structs in other languages. It is simply a collection of fields. 
If we take the example on the page and split it into two packages like this

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"play.ground/foo"
)

func main() {
	v := foo.Vertex{1, 2}
	v.X = 4
	v.Y = 6
	fmt.Println(v.Y)
}
-- go.mod --
module play.ground
-- foo/foo.go --
package foo

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/vCGDLHS5JMh)
```
6
```
If we change the code to make the field `y` unexported;
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"play.ground/foo"
)

func main() {
	v := foo.Vertex{1, 2}
	v.X = 4
	v.y = 6
	fmt.Println(v.y)
}
-- go.mod --
module play.ground
-- foo/foo.go --
package foo

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	y int
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/TGnpMZ1z5aI)
```
# play.ground
./prog.go:10:21: implicit assignment to unexported field y in foo.Vertex literal
./prog.go:12:4: v.y undefined (type foo.Vertex has no field or method y)
./prog.go:13:16: v.y undefined (type foo.Vertex has no field or method y)
```
we can easily see that every reference to the field `y` is an error. This is because the field `y` is unexported, and only the package `foo` can access it. But we should keep in mind that the `Vertex` struct itself and its field `X` is accessible, because they are exported. So having access to a struct does not mean you have access to all of its fields.



**The pointer usage helps the memory management, and gives an easy way to modify the contents of the variables on the inner functions. But it is also prone to unexpected changes to your variable. Value arguments on the other hand are hard on memory consumption and overall performance of the application.**
