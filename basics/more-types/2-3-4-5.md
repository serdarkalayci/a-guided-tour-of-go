### Structs & Struct Fields
> A struct is a collection of fields.

A struct in Go is very similar to structs in other languages. It is simply a collection of fields. 
Each field of the struct is evaluated individually whether or not they are exported. If we take the example on the page and split it into two packages like this

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"play.ground/foo"
)

func main() {
	v := foo.Vertex{X: 1, Y: 2}
	v.X = 4
	v.Y = 6
	fmt.Println(v.Y)
}
-- go.mod --
module play.ground
-- foo/foo.go --
package foo

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/S8HAK_ScZYU)
```
6
```
If we change the code to make the field `y` unexported;
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"play.ground/foo"
)

func main() {
	v := foo.Vertex{1, 2}
	v.X = 4
	v.y = 6
	fmt.Println(v.y)
}
-- go.mod --
module play.ground
-- foo/foo.go --
package foo

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	y int
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/TGnpMZ1z5aI)
```
./prog.go:10:21: implicit assignment to unexported field y in foo.Vertex literal
./prog.go:12:4: v.y undefined (type foo.Vertex has no field or method y)
./prog.go:13:16: v.y undefined (type foo.Vertex has no field or method y)
```
we can easily see that every reference to the field `y` is an error. This is because the field `y` is unexported, and only the package `foo` can access it. But we should keep in mind that the `Vertex` struct itself and its field `X` is accessible, because they are exported. So having access to a struct does not mean you have access to all of its fields.

### Pointers to structs

There's nothing special about pointers to structs. They are just like pointers to any other type. The only difference is that the struct is a collection of fields, and the pointer points to the struct itself. Hence the syntax `(*p).X` but as the page explains that for the sake of clarity in the code, the compiler does an automatic deference on struct types. This automatic defereferencing sometimes causes confusion, and sometimes lead people forget that they are working with a pointer. So it is better to use the explicit syntax `(*p).X` to make it clear that we are working with a pointer. 
One more thing to remember is that the `.` operator binds stronger than the `*` operator. So `*p.X` is equivalent to `*(p.X)` which is not what we want unless `X` itself is a pointer. Again we have to use paranthesis to tell the compiler our exact intention.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X *int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	x := 1
	v := &Vertex{&x, 2}
	fmt.Printf("(*v).X = %v\n", (*v).X)   // Address of X
	fmt.Printf("*v.X = %v\n", *v.X)       // Value of X. Deferencing operator (*) applies to v.X not v
	fmt.Printf("*(*v).X = %v\n", *(*v).X) // Value of X
	*v.X = 3                              // Change value of X. Deferencing operator (*) applies to v.X not v
	fmt.Printf("*v.X = %v\n", *v.X)       // Value of X. Deferencing operator (*) applies to v.X not v
	//v.X = 3 // cannot use 3 (untyped int constant) as *int value in assignment
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/abQzZ-q-XXD)
```
(*v).X = 0xc000012028
*v.X = 1
*(*v).X = 1
*v.X = 3
```

The last line of the example is commented out because it gives a syntax error. The reason is that the type of `v.X` is `*int` and the type of `3` is `int`. So we cannot assign an `int` to a `*int`. When we want to update the value of `X`, we should do it like we did on line 16.

**Sometimes structs hold a great amount of data (e.g. when we fill the struct type by unmarshalling a json file) and passing that object as a value to the functions create copies of it, resulting a non-optimal memory usage. If there's no specific reason to do the opposite, it's a good practice to use pointers of structs instead of passing them as value.**

### Struct Literals
There are two syntaxes to assing a struct literal to a variable which are the keyed syntax `v := Vertex{X: 1, Y: 2}` and unkeyed syntax `v := Vertex{1, 2}`. As anyone would guess, the unkeyed version uses the order of the fields to assign the values. The keyed version is more readable and it is a good practice to use it. Also if you're using a struct from a different package, using the unkeyed version will still compile but Go Vet will give you a warning. 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"play.ground/foo"
)

func main() {
	v := foo.Vertex{1, 2}
	v.X = 4
	v.Y = 6
	fmt.Println(v.Y)
}
-- go.mod --
module play.ground
-- foo/foo.go --
package foo

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}
```

```
./prog.go:10:7: play.ground/foo.Vertex struct literal uses unkeyed fields
Go vet failed.

```

There's a gotcha about struct literals, and the example on the page only covers the initialization/assignment of variables to struct literals. As we all now know, Golang is designed to remove the unnecessary keywords and symbols from the language. Clauses like `if` and `for` do not require parenthesis `( )`, but the braces `{ }` are required. So the following code shouold compile, but it does not.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y int
}

var (
	v1 = Vertex{1, 2}  // has type Vertex
)

func main() {
	if v1 == Vertex{1, 2} {
		fmt.Println("Equal")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Not Equal")
	}
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/ocEAU8J-I5u)
```
./prog.go:14:22: syntax error: unexpected }, expected := or = or comma
./prog.go:16:4: syntax error: unexpected else after top level declaration

Go build failed.
```

This is explained in the [language specification about composite literals](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Composite_literals) as follows;
> A parsing ambiguity arises when a composite literal using the TypeName form of the LiteralType appears as an operand between the keyword and the opening brace of the block of an "if", "for", or "switch" statement, and the composite literal is not enclosed in parentheses, square brackets, or curly braces. In this rare case, the opening brace of the literal is erroneously parsed as the one introducing the block of statements. To resolve the ambiguity, the composite literal must appear within parentheses.

The code above should be written like this, which compiles and runs as expected.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y int
}

var (
	v1 = Vertex{1, 2}  // has type Vertex
)

func main() {
	if (v1 == Vertex{1, 2}) {
		fmt.Println("Equal")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Not Equal")
	}
}
```
[Run on Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/d2iOGD4deft)
```
Equal

Program exited.
```

This is not the only way to fix that if statement. We can also use the paranthesis to enclose the struct literal, like this;
```go
	if v1 == (Vertex{1, 2}) {
		...
	}
```
