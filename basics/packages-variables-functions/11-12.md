Go is designed to be simple. So its basic types. There are `bool`, `string` and different sizes of `int`, `uint`, `float` and `complex`. There are some aliases of `int`.

- `int` which selects the size `int32` or `int64` depending on your OS architecture.
- `byte` is `uint8` which essentially used for `utf8` characters, which is the default setting for string literals in Go.
- `rune` is `int32` which is used for `unicode` characters.

The following code represents a string literal `ABCðŸ¤·DEF` is being converted to `byte slice` and `rune slice` respectively (slices is a subject a bit down the line for this moment, you can think of them as arrays for now), and then converted back to `string`. Remember, `string` itself is a `byte slice` for Go.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	b := []byte("ABCðŸ¤·DEF")
	s1 := string(b)
	fmt.Println(b)
	fmt.Println(s1)
	r := []rune("ABCðŸ¤·DEF")
	s2 := string(r)
	fmt.Println(r)
	fmt.Println(s2)
}
```

[65 66 67 240 159 164 183 68 69 70]
ABCðŸ¤·DEF
[65 66 67 129335 68 69 70]
ABCðŸ¤·DEF
```
There are 7 characters there, the first and last three `ABC` and `DEF` are ASCII characters. An ASCII character takes up 7 bits, which fits into a `byte`. The fourth character `ðŸ¤·` is a unicode one and does not fit into a `byte`, so in `byte array` form it is represented in 4 seperate items in the slice. `65 66 67` are representing `ABC`, `240 159 164 183` are representing `ðŸ¤·` and `68 69 70` are representing `DEF`. In `rune slice` however, every character is represented as one item, the one representing `ðŸ¤·` being a big one. So how does `string()` function knows those first three items represent three different characters and the next four represents a single one? First 7 bits of a byte (that's 127 in decimal, which represents a delete character which is invisible) there's a one-to-one match with an ASCII character. After the 8th bit (from 128 to 255) it's an unknown one (the infamouos ï¿½) and the compiler takes the liberty of checking the following bytes until it makes sense as a `code point` in unicode. The example below shows characters between 125 and 129 and what they represent by themselves. And later you can see that the first three bytes of our `ðŸ¤·` does not mean anything for the compiler without the fourth byte.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	b1 := []byte{125, 126, 127, 128, 129}
	s1 := string(b1)
	fmt.Println(s1)
	b2 := []byte{240, 159, 164}
	s2 := string(b2)
	fmt.Println(s2)
}

As for the zero values in Go, there is not much to memorize. It's 0 for all numeric types, false for bool and empty string for string. As we discovered, there is a few basic types in Go, there are fewer complex types namely slices and maps. There are also structs but they are structures which you can bundle one or more types we mentioned here. They'll have their seperate parts in our tour later on, but for now just keep in mind the zero values of slices and maps are empty slices and empty maps. Yoou can inspect the following code and run to see it for yourself to see uninitialized and initialized examples of those complex types. 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
	name         string
	age          int
	luckyNumbers []int
	posessions   map[string]int
}

func main() {
	var noone person //Uninitialized struct
	fmt.Printf("NoOne's name is %s, his age is %d, his lucky numbers are %v and his posessions are %v\n", noone.name, noone.age, noone.luckyNumbers, noone.posessions)
	john := person{} //Initialized struct with uninitialized fields
	fmt.Printf("John's name is %s, his age is %d, his lucky numbers are %v and his posessions are %v\n", john.name, john.age, john.luckyNumbers, john.posessions)
	jane := person{name: "Jane Doe", age: 21, luckyNumbers: []int{7, 42, 64}, posessions: map[string]int{"apple": 5, "orange": 3}} //Inititialized fully
	fmt.Printf("Jane's name is %s, her age is %d, her lucky numbers are %v and her posessions are %v\n", jane.name, jane.age, jane.luckyNumbers, jane.posessions)
}
```

```
NoOne's name is , his age is 0, his lucky numbers are [] and his posessions are map[]
John's name is , his age is 0, his lucky numbers are [] and his posessions are map[]
Jane's name is Jane Doe, her age is 21, her lucky numbers are [7 42 64] and her posessions are map[apple:5 orange:3]
```
