## Type inference

[[Type inference] https://go.dev/tour/basics/14](https://go.dev/tour/basics/14)

Some human assumptions on type inference may turn out wrong. Consider the following code and try to guess the value and the type of watzit
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	watzit := 5 / 2
	fmt.Printf("The value of watzit is %d and the type is %T\n", watzit, watzit)
}
```

It's easy to divide 5 to 2 for us, and natural answer to this question would be 2.5 as value and `float64` as the type. The real output is like the following
```
The value of watzit is 2 and the type is int
```
The reason is very simple and we'll understand when we inspect the following code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	watzit := 5 / 2
	fmt.Printf("The value of watzit is %d and the type is %T\n", watzit, watzit)
	watzthis := 5 / 2.0
	fmt.Printf("The value of watzthis is %f and the type is %T\n", watzthis, watzthis)
}
```

```
The value of watzit is 2 and the type is int
The value of watzthis is 2.500000 and the type is float64
```
The result of any arithmetic operation between two integers is an `integer` for Go. In this example 2 and 5 are **integer literals** and the division will be and integer. In the second arithmetic operation returns a `float64` because 2.0 is a **float literal**. 

**It's important to be careful about the type of the inferred side if you're to use the short declaration form. If you're not sure it's always better to be safe than sorry and use the full variable declaration instead of short one.**
