## Welcome to A -Guided- Tour of Go

Golang's [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) is a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn Go. A while back, we started something we call *Golang Dojo* with my colleagues from [Container Solutions](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions) who wants to learn Go from scratch or sharpen their skills in the language. It was a weekly mob-learning session where we mostly followed A Tour of Go. The beauty of mob learning with so many curious minds is there were lots of "What if"s in every example. As the moderator of the Golang Dojo, I summarized each session so anyone who missed the session would catch up later. Then I noticed that, those what if scenarios created a wider and easier to grasp curriculum. So I decided to convert my short summaries into what I call A -Guided- Tour of Go. 

Here, we'll follow A Tour of Go's pages, and while we're on it, we'll create alternatives like "what if we change that line into this" or "what if we delete this block" or "what if we change the order of these blocks". I won't be repeating the explanations that're already on A Tour of Go pages. Instead I'll assume that you've read the explanations there and tried the example that's provided on that page. I'll provide additional information as needed, and some more examples to elaborate more on the subject in hand.
